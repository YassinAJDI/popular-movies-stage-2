### App Description
This app displays popular and top rated movies from [**The Movie Db**](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API. 
Details of each movie is displayed in the detail screen, where the user can view listed trailers for each 
movie and to read all reviews. Allows the user to safe movie in their favorites collection storring it 
into a local database.

## What I Learned

- Fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
- Use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
- Incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code I need to write
- Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button.
- Create a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies.
- Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their 
favorites collection.

## Libraries

- [Retrofit2](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
- [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso)
- [Butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife)

## API KEY Notes

In order to run this app please add your own **API key** from [**The Movie Db**](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

Place **YOUR_API_KEY** to **build.gradle** `System.getenv('API_KEY') ?: "\"[YOUR_API_KEY]\"")`, 
so that the app can fetch movie data from the API.
